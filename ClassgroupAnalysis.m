% Do you want to use the function ttest or ttest2 (look at the help)
% Use the t-test to find the p-value determine if there is a difference between SNR thresholds for each pitch;
% This will be a bit tricky â€“ look at help to determine how you need to organinse the input.
% What is the correlation between 500 and 1500 Hz threshold across subjects?
% Can you plot this?
