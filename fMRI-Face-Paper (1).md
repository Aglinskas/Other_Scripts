# fMRI Face Paper

# Abstract

Familiar faces prompt the recall of diverse kinds of person-related knowledge (name, occupation, personal experiences, associated social and perceptual traits). The way this information is dynamically encoded within the well-characterised ‘face’ network (core and extended systems is still uncertain. To address this issue we had participants access five different kinds of person knowledge (social, episodic, biographical, physical, nominal) through ten different tasks. By directly comparing different cognitions, we are able to: 1) test relative role of specific cognitive processes in specific brain regions, such as the role of the ATL is social or nominal knowledge and 2) apply a novel Network level Representational Similarity Analysis (netRSA) to gain insight into underlying systems-level organisation of **person-knowledge network. netRSA reveal a strong divide between regions involved in internalised cognition(precuneus, mFG, ATL etc)  and the rest of the network.  The IFG and OFC coordinate closely with early perceptual regions in the core system (FFA, OFA, pSTS). The relatively recently characterised ‘anterior temporal face patch’ (ATFP) has cognitive responsive profile that is more consistent with regions belonging to extended system regions, most consistently clustering with the amygdala. Collectively the results show 


# Introduction

Seeing a familiar person brings into awareness a variety of related attributes: biographical facts (semantic knowledge), personal experience (episodic knowledge), physical attributes (perceptual knowledge), trustworthiness (social knowledge) or their name (nominal knowledge).  We use this rich trove of person specific information frequently in our day-to-day lives. However, it is still largely unclear how this diverse information is represented in the brain.  
Neuroimaging studies have identified an interconnected network of regions activated when we see and think about other people {Haxby:2000vnb, Gobbini:2007it, Fairhall:2007dq}. This network is composed of a perceptual ‘core system’, the occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA, FFA) {Gauthier:2000it, Kanwisher:1997wr} and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). This core is complemented by an ‘extended system’ - a more loosely grouped set of regions implicated in a broad range of person-related cognition unrelated to perception {Haxby:2000vnb}. The extended system includes: the amydgalae, anterior temporal lobes (ATL), precuneus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), inferior frontal gyri and lateral orbitofrontal cortex and potentially the recently identified anterior temporal face patch ATFP ({Rajimehr:2009ka} + Tsao, Moeller & Freiwald, 2008???) although the perceptual/extra-perceptual role of the ATFP remains uncertain. 
Numerous investigations of contribution of these regions to the function of the extended system have produced diverse and at times discordant results (c.f. table 1). For example, while the pSTS is characterised as a core region, it is frequently linked with social and other person-related cognition unrelated to perception (Adolphs:2003cy,KosterHale:2017bd,Fairhall 2013hn), suggesting that pSTS might not be functionally homogenous (Haxby (or Gobbini and Haxby ??) 2007 ref see also ‘the psts, it’s my area isn't it’). . Likewise, the varied functional attributions of the of the ATL to proper naming {Semenza:2011hn, Grabowski:2001jk, Gesierich:2011tv}, person recognition {Olson:2007jm, Glosser:2003eh, Tippett:2000ez} and social cognition (ref ref ; see simmons and martin for a review) - suggest this region may have amore complex response profile and cognitive role. 
One potential reason for the lack of consensus is the extensively broad range of functions attributable to regions of the extended system. Anatomically, the extended system falls within the intrinsic brain network - a collections of brain regions associated with a range of internalised cognitive processes. Originally characterised as a task-deactivated ‘default mode’ state {Raichle:2001fk}, this network is associated with a broad range of internalised cognitive processes:  general semantic knowledge {Binder:2009je, Huth:2016jd,Fairhall:2013iq}; social cognition, {social cognition, trait attribution, Theory of Mind and more; Greene:2001ft}, {VanOverwalle:2009eh, VanOverwalle:2011jp}, episodic memory and mental time travel (Dona Rose and Schacter). As elements of the internalised cognition network are frequently activated together, establishing whether these regions provide overlapping of distinct contributions has been challenging {VanOverwalle:2011jp, Moran:2011ct}. When studied in isolation, each region will be attributable to the researchers cognition-of-interest.  
A further reason for the lack of consensus in the literature may be the tendency of individual studies to address specific cognitive functions in specific brain regions. Regions of the extended system activate across simple repetition detection tasks or categorisation tasks (Fairhall, Ubaldi et al, 2014; or something better) and most regions may be recruited to some extent across multiple experimental contexts. The important factor may be the *relative* change of a given region, compared to other brain regions and other cognitive contexts. 
The goals of the current experiment are twofold. The first is to examine the roles of key brain regions in cognitive function considering these regions both in context of different cognition and other brain regions. Specifically, we shall investigate the role of the anterior temporal lobe in social cognition and nominal knowledge and the role of the posterior STS and TPJ in cognitive perceptual processes. Our second goal is examine the pan-network response to differing cognitive demands. We hypothesise that all these regions are involved and strongly activated across the range of cognitive dimensions related to other people but that the cognitive flexibility of this network is endowed by subtle differences across the network. Specifically, we identify the network activated when we view familiar faces during a simple stimulus repetition detection task. Then we push the network towards different aspects of person knowledge (social, semantic, episodic, nominal and physical ) to understand the relative importance of these processes to each region.

# Methods
## Participants

Twenty right-handed, native Italian participants (8 males; mean age: 23.2 years, range: 19-32 years) took part in this study.  Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological incident. The study was approved by University of Trento ethical committee. All participants gave informed consent and were compensated for their time.

## Stimuli

Stimuli were 40 pictures of famous faces and 40 pictures of famous buildings. The stimulus set consisted of politicians, actors, singers, businessmen and sportsmen – both foreign and Italian, and landmarks (Eiffel tower, colosseum). Pictures of faces were manually aligned on facial landmarks (eyes, lips, mouth). Stimuli were presented centered on the screen (1280x1024 resolution, 60hz refresh rate), with grey background. 
After the experiment 13/20 participants were presented with faces they saw in the experiment and asked whether they recognised the celebrity. On average, the subjects recognised M=84%  of faces.

## Task
![Schematic representation of the experiment. Five Domains of person knowledge and two questions per domain are noted in different colours (top). Experimental blocks were preceded by 4s of instruction screen, and 6s fixation point. Each trial consisted of .5s face presentation and 2s for response.](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1509457604446_Screen+Shot+2017-10-31+at+14.45.53+3.png)


Each experimental block started with 4s instruction screen specifying the task, followed by 6s of fixation cross. After that a face was presented for .5s followed by 2s of fixation cross during which subjects provided a response via button box.  
The experiment consisted of five runs (8 min 42 s each). In each run, 16 blocks (8 trial per block) were presented in a randomised order. 
Within each block, participants were instructed to respond to questions covering five categories of person knowledge: episodic memories, biographical knowledge, social judgments, nominal knowledge, perceptual knowledge. For each of the categories, we chose two different probe questions that require access to each kind of knowledge (totalling ten experimental conditions; see figure X and table XX). In addition there were two 1-back matching control task with either pictures of faces or famous monuments.

![Table: Experimental questions. We selected five categories of person related knowledge (nominal, perceptual, episodic, social and biographical). For each category we chose two different probe question that require accessing specific knowledge category. ](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1510754583229_Screen+Shot+2017-11-15+at+14.59.56.png)


Prior to scanning, participants practised answering experimental questions on a different stimulus set (the questions were the same, faces were different). Participants answered 9/10 questions using a 1-4 Likert scale. Occupation question (“what is this persons’ occupation”) had predefined categories (actor or TV presenter, singer or musician, politician or sportsman, or none of the above).

## Data Acquisition

Participants were scanned at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University of Trento. Data was collected using Bruker BioSpin MedSpec 4T, with 8-channel phased-array head coil. Five runs of 209 EPI volumes, consisting of 34, AC-PC aligned axial slices were acquired while participants performed the task (FOV = 64mm x 64mm, TR=2.5s, TE=33, FA=73°). Voxel size was 3x3x3(mm) with a 1mm gap.
In addition to functional data, whole brain T1 MPRAGE anatomical image was acquired (whole brain  (FOV= 256x224, 176 1mm axial slices).

## ROI definition

Regions of interest were selected from an independent (N=42) experiment, conducted for high power functional localisation. In localiser experiment participants performed a 1-back matching task with 12 second (check) blocks of famous faces, common animals or common objects. 

[ ] check N=42 block length

Contrast faces**>**animals+tools (p < .05 FWE) was used to select face selective peaks (table x)**.**  7.5mm radius spheres were drawn around the peak voxels and task evoked brain responses (betas) were extracted (one beta per ROI/task/subject). 
To address whether pSTS and angular gyrus/TPJ are functionally overlapping or distinct (see introduction) we anatomically constrained the volume with angular and superior temporal gyri masks. Then the masks were inflated and the overlap was removed. This allowed us to distinguish face selective anatomical activation within anatomical angular and superior temporal gyri, removing the overlap helped ensure that the angular and pSTS ROIs did not cross anatomical boundaries.

## Data Analysis

Data was preprocessed with SPM12. Functional images were realigned to account for motion, grey matter segmented, and warped into common space and smoothed with 8mm FWHM kernel. Subject specific response estimates (Beta weights) were derived by fitting a general linear model (GLM) to the data. 12 regressors (10 tasks, 2 controls) were included as explanatory variables. Six motion parameters from re-alignemnt procedure were included as regressors of no interest.
We drew 7.5mm spheres around peak coordinates (table x), and extracted the mean beta value from significantly active at p<0.1 within those ROIs. To isolate the magnitude of cognitive response, from each ROI values (10 values, one value per cognitive task) we subtracted beta value for 1-back matching face control task.   

## Multivariate Analyses

ROI responses across tasks were averaged across voxels and correlated to obtain a dissimilarity matrix (1-*R*), which was then subjected to clustering using Ward (ref) algorithm (netRSA). Similarly, for task similarity analysis (task-RSA) the matrix was tilted so that similarity matrix consisted of task correlation across ROIs.

![Data analysis schematic. ROI beta averages for ten tasks were correlated and subjected to RSA.  ](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1509468137490_Screen+Shot+2017-10-31+at+17.41.24.png)

## Univariate Analyses
[ ] ***[move to results. split up ROIs and tasks?]***

The ten tasks were condensed into the  collapsed into the five domains of knowledge (i.e. collapsed across the similar task pairs. Bilateral ROIs were also collapsed as there were no main effects (?) (…interactions…??) of/with hemispheres.

# Results

Subjects were presented with faces of famous people and answered questions that involved different kinds of person knowledge. Twenty-one (21) face selective ROIs were selected from an independent dataset (faces > places contrast, N=44). We performed univariate analyses and multivariate network RSA to address questions about regional involvement in person knowledge as well as network function. 

## Reaction times

Mean reaction time was x̅ = 1.20, SD = 0.11. Reaction times (RTs) differed across the 10 tasks F(9,190) = 17.13, p<.001. Criticially, this RT effect did not persist when tasks were collapsed into the five domains of knowledge used in the imaging analysis (i.e. ‘Nominal' 'Physical' 'Social' 'Episodic' 'Factual’; F(4**,**95) = 2.21 p=.076. RT did not differ between the two control tasks (face/place 1-back matching tasks) t(18) = 1.96, p= .066. 
Mean ratings ranged from x̅ = 2.2, SD = 0.25 (attractiveness task) to x̅ = 3.1, SD = .38 (full name task). Ratings differed significantly across 10 exemplar tasks F(9,190) = 19.77, p<.001. To check whether task ratings influence task representation in the brain, we constructed RSA model of similarly rated tasks and compared it task similarity across the network (see: Cognitive Taxonomy). The rating similarity did not explain any significant amount of task similarity t(19) = 1.77. p = .094.

## Access to all information activated all regions (Except core)

To justify further analyses, we first checked whether regions were responsive to the experimental paradigm. As expected, regions in the extended system were engaged more on average during tasks that required semantic access than face one-back matching control task (all T values > 1.98, all p < .02)

Before moving onto systems level organisation, we address competing hypotheses about the functional role of brain regions. As previously discussed, whether the ATL is involved more in nominal, social or semantic processing is a matter of current contention. The relative importance of our five cognitive domains was assessed directly via repeated measures ANOVA. As there were no interactions between task and hemisphere  in ATL or IFG (f-values < 1.7 , p-values > .074) subsequent results are presented collapsed across hemisphere. A main effect of task in ATL  *F*(4,95) = 8.13, p= < .001 was driven by a reduced response to nominal tasks compared to episodic, factual, social or physical tasks (all t-values > 2.49, all p-values< .02). No other pairwise comparisons were significant. 
IFG also was significantly modulated by task F(4,95) = 13,77, p<.001. Post-hoc tests revealed that IFG responded more to nominal tasks than social tasks t(19) = 3.1, p = .006
**Perceptual and non-perceptual processing in the** **pSTS/Angular**
Angular gyrus responded to all experimental tasks compared to 1-back face matching control task. In addition Angular gyrus responded more during episodic memory retrieval than any other task (t> 2.8 p< .0102). In contrast, while pSTS showed a face selective response, responding more to 1-back matching task containing faces than monuments t(19) = 2.34, p=.03 it did not respond positively to any of the experimental tasks. 
There was a significant task by hemisphere interaction, the difference between episodic-social and episodic-nominal tasks was more pronounced on the right hemisphere (bonferroni corrected).


## Regional organisation hypotheses 

Regions if core and extended systems are charaterised by their response similarity. Core regions respond to perceptual freatures of the face, while extended responds more to semantic. However, some research suggests that IFG might be part of core and dmn
to test competing hypotheses about network organisation, we fitted competing models to the data. We then each subject's data with the models, and per
**Hypothesis 1**
First, to test whether regions associated with externalised cognition (IFG, OFC) co-ordinate more closely with core or extended systems, we build competing models for both (model 1, where IFG-OFC are connected to core, model 2 where IFG-OFC are connected to regions of the internalised cognition regions). Results showed that externalised cognition regions co-ordinate more closely resemble those of core system than internalised cognition regions paired sampled t(19)=3.05, p=0.007.

network level Representational Similarity Analysis (netRSA). For each ROI, pan-task beta patterns were pairwise correlated and subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis (see methods), which identified three distinct clusters (figure 2). The most immediately striking feature of the result is the close proximity of left and right regional homologues. In all cases, despite the anatomical distance, a given ROI’s cognitive profile matched most closely to that of its contralateral counterpart. This is an important internal validation of the netRSA approach (to our knowledge this is the first implementation of such an approach). 
netRSA revealed both the expected cognitive clustering of core regions (OFA, FFA, pSTS) and the interesting cognitive coupling of these regions with the the orbito-frontal and inferior frontal gyri (OFC & IFG; Cluster 1,’Core-Frontal’,red).  Within the extended system, regions overlapping with those involved in default mode and canonically associated with internalised cognition form a distinct cluster (Cluster 2,’extended-DMN’,green) from amygdala and the anterior face patch (Cluster 3,’extended-ventromedial’,purple).  
***Hierarchical clustering is a non-frequentist approach. There is no assessment of the (random) probability or the replicability of the result. To permit inference we compared the data to a priori models of network structures, employing an RSA approach (see figure). First model - where are IFG and OFC, Second model, what about aTFP?*
*We went on to confirm that the AG goes extended and the pSTS core as anticipated by previous section, was there something else…?* 
To further assess *r**e**liability of the result* we compared mean within cluster correlation (e.g OFA-IFG) with across cluster correlation (e.g OFA-Precuneus). Within cluster correlation was significantly higher than across t(19) = 8.29, p<.001. 
Additionally, we  performed bootstrapping replicability analysis by resampling, with replacement, 10/20 subjects and recomputing the clustering for 10 000 iterations (see cluster stability). 
Regions of the core-frontal produce reliably different patterns of activity (78%) (figure x). Within the extended system, regions involved in default-mode (DMN) can also be reliably differentiated based on their response profiles (93%). Amygdala and ATFP clusters reliably together (88%). All together, regional clustering is robust and three clusters identified in group average can be identified across resampling iterations

## Cognitive Taxonomy

Our condition-rich experimental design afforded an unique opportunity to quantitatively compare patterns of activity related to different cognitive tasks. Allows us to ask the important questions: ‘according to the brain, how similar are different aspects of consipfici related cognition?’ netRSA was performed across ROIs to investigate how similar are the neural representations of different experimental conditions (Figure 3.). 
A striking feature of this analysis is that despite the variety in tasks and reactions times, the ***[you’re over-using ‘a priori’]*** task pairs for each cognitive domain (e.g. ‘common name’ and ‘full name’ for nominal knowledge retrieval) are grouped together. This  illustrates the efficacy of netRSA in this context as will as providing another internal validation.

At the next level of heriachical clustering, results reveal three distinct clusters of tasks, within cluster correlations are significantly higher than across t(19) = 5.24 p<  .001. Physical (yellow) and social (blue) knowledge relies on similar patterns of activity ***[don’t we need a p value here as well? …if we go this way].*** as does retrieval of episodic (pink) and biographical (purple) knowledge, both clusters are distinct from nominal knowledge retrieval, which produces a unique pattern.

## Preference Patterns (cognitive fingerprint?)

The preceding sections illustrate that different cognitive roles are characterised by distinct patterns of activation across the person-knowledge network. To characterise this pattern we compare cognitive turning across the different regions to attain a cortical ‘fingerprint’ of the respective cognitive processes. For every ROI we compared its activation for each task and the mean activation during other tasks in a paired samples t-test (figure x). Regions and tasks are grouped based on the result of multivariate clustering (see network taxonomy, cognitive taxonomy). 
Perceptual and social knowledge are represented in a distributed fashion across multiple regions, while nominal knowledge and episodic memories load strongly on a single region (IFG and angular gyrus, respectively). Perceptual tasks evoked more activity than other cognitions in the core-frontal component if the network (figure 2, red) while social knowledge particularly engaged internalised cognition cluster (figure 2, green).
The cognitive preference patterns are computed to highlight the differences between the tasks, given the robustness of multivariate netRSA clustering, we conclude that results of the clustering is due to subtle similarities between tasks that are imperceptible in univariate analyses. 

## Whole Brain Analysis - Beyond the person-selective network

The motivation of this project was to gain insight into the normal function of the well-characterised network for person knowledge by strongly pushing it towards different access to different domains of knowledge. These cognitive functions are not accomplished solely by the person knowledge system and it is important to consider that these systems presumably pair and couple with brain regions outside the person-selective network (‘potentially drive specialisation within’ - perhaps soft conclusion to this section).
After having demonstrated that most regions in the extended system do not specialise for one specific task but instead actively respond to more than one, in some cases all tasks (e.g. Left IFG) we have to remind ourselves that even though different cognitions rely on overlapping neural substrates, each different cognition engages the brain in a different way. 
Access nominal knowledge is characterised by a broad pattern of activation, stronger on the left hemisphere than the right (figure). It encompasses well-known sites of activation associated with language production, such as Wernickes area, Broca’s area, as well as superior frontal gyri, as well left OFC and left FFA.
Conversely, accessing perceptual knowledge is more pronounced on the right than the left hemisphere, and includes right IFG and right OFC and right FFA.
Social knowledge retrieval activates left ATL and dmPFC also consistent with previous literature.
Recalling episodic memories involved the precuneus, angular gyrus as well as right later frontal pole and bilateral SFG to a greater extent than other tasks do. 
Factual knowledge retrieval tasks did not produce significant clusters of activity.

# Discussion

Cognitive processes are distributed across networks of regions. By having our participants perform a broad range of cognitive tasks and exploiting data complexity through derivations of statistical tools such as RSA, we could focus on the subtle differences in inter-regional coordination that endow distributed cortical networks their considerable cognitive flexibility. By relating task activity not only to a baseline but to activity during other tasks we were able to establish regional preferences which allowed us to tackle specific hypothesis about regional function. Leveraging multivariate methods provided insight into regional coordination, uncovering robust principles of network organisation as well as the similarity between different cognitive processes to build a cognitive taxonomy grounded in brain representation. 
**IFG and OFC are involved in ’core’ function**
By focusing on patterns of activation across a range of tasks instead of percent change magnitude we were able to characterise core and extended system regions based on their response similarity. Our results show that regions involved in perception and cognition are systematically differentiable. OFA, FFA and pSTS are more similar to each other than they are to, for example, internalised cognition network also known as the DMN. OFC and IFG, frontal regions involved in a broad range of cognitive tasks (table 1), systematically displayed response profiles that are more consistent to ‘core’  function. This finding is consistent with some previous studies. DCM studies have been successful in showing the connectivity within the network. {Fairhall:2007dqa} showed that pre-frontal cortices form task induced connection with regions of the core system when person-related information is being extracted from a face.  {Druzgal:2003eq} observed high similarity in the time course of FFA and IFG. Additionally, they found that while FFA was not strongly affected by whether there were one, two, or three faces on the screen, this parametrically modulated the IFG. {Mechelli:2004cp} found that this connection between FFA and IFG is face specific, disappearing if the stimulus changes from faces, to chairs. These evidence, together with the current experiment presented here, suggest that some regions in the frontal lobe, such as the IFG and OFC might be necessary to ‘core’ function of face perception. 
[{diOleggioCastello:2017ip}](http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/138297) found increasing head-view invariance gradient from occipital to frontal regions. OFA, FFA were found to be sensitive to head-view and insensitive to identity, ATFP was sensitive to both head-view and identity and IFG was head-view invariant leading to proposal that IFG is the a robust part o the core system. Interestingly, while authors ascribe ATFP to the core system, data driven similarity measures (multidimensional scaling) put middle and anterior fusiform regions midway between core and extended systems in terms of similarity. 

**Subdivisions in the extended system: extended-DMN and extended-VM**
Having found expected divisions within core and extended system regions we turned to see whether there is more fine grained differentiation within the extended system. We've observed close functional coordination between regions involved in internalised cognition, that is distinct from the contribution that amygdala and ATFP provide to person perception. ATFP had a response profile consistent with that of an extended system region, however the results should be interpreted with caution because there was no strong univariate effects, and ATFP region is susceptible to signal dropout. Nevertheless, ATFP coordination with the extended system seems to be a replicable finding. {Shao:2017bf} evaluated activation profiles of face selective regions in a high a condition-rich experiment. In a single experiment, they presented participants with pictures of items form 16 different categories (faces, houses, animals, tools etc.). Relying on activation pattern across conditions, instead of magnitude response, authors were able to characterise the organisation of the core face perception system, distinct response profiles between two different parts of pSTS, ventral pSTS has a response profile consistent with regions of the core system, and dorsal pSTS (region overlapping with the angular gyrus), together with ATFP that have similar profile between themselves that is distinct from core behaviour.

By directly comparing different cognitions it is possible to delineate the contributions of regions to person perception. {Moran:2011ct} contrasted physical judgements and character judgements about people and found that mPFC responds more to character judgements and the precuneus responds more to physical judgments. Such inference would not have been possible without a direct comparison of cognitions in a single experiment.  With machine learning techniques such as pattern classification and clustering analyses gaining popularity in neuroscientific research, using rich, varying stimuli as opposed to controlled stimuli has increasingly been an advantage. Sampling semantic categories widely allows to examine brain patterns more robustly, leading to better MVP classification accuracies {Mitchell:2008iz}, and ascribe very specific cognitive functions to brain regions {Huth:2016ih}. However, clearly there is a balance to be struck between using rich and controlled stimuli as using stimuli that vary a lot can impair interpretability of results (i.e brain activity patterns that only classifier understands) {e.g Mitchell:2008iz}.

## Regional tuning of ATL, IFG

The importance of anterior temporal lobes to both conceptual and person knowledge has been strongly supported by evidence. However, with ATL being implicated in a wide variety of tasks its more precise function remains shrouded in eternal mystery. Different hypotheses propose that ATL might mediate person-specific social knowledge {Olson:2007jm}, proper naming {Semenza:2011hn}, or act as a semantic hub for all kinds of conceptual knowledge {Patterson:2007bw}. {Gesierich:2011eu} showed that ATL is involved in semantic processing regardless of lexical access. We were able to replicate this finding and further narrow down ATL function by showing that is it not responding to tasks loading on nominal knowledge, but does respond to most other kinds of knowledge retrieval. Current hub-and-spoke model of knowledge representation is inconsistent with these findings as it hypothesises that all modality specific sources, converge in the ATL {Ralph:2016gh}. It is however, plausible that nominal knowledge is represented in a different way from other kinds of knowledge (see below: task representation).
Our network-RSA results shed further light on ATL activity by showing that at least during person perception tasks it works in close coordination with other regions of the default-mode network, acting as part of a distinct functional unit instead of working in isolation. 
We’ve found no evidence of ATL preferential response to naming tasks despite numerous studies that have found robust ATL activation during proper naming, instead we’ve observed strong IFG involvement in naming tasks. Left IFG showed face selective response, responding to all tasks that had a face stimulus but also exhibited a boost in activation during nominal knowledge retrieval tasks, showing a cognitive preference. 

## Cognitive Taxonomy in Person Knowledge 

By looking at how differing cognitive processes rely on similar or diverse neural structures one can get an insight into the way cognitive processes are represented in the mind. For each kind of knowledge tested (physical, social, semantic, episodic, nominal) we selected two exemplar tasks that required the participant to make different kinds of judgements about a person (eg. trustworthy or friendly) while still belonging to the same category (both are social judgements). First, the apriori selected task exemplars were matched together during clustering. Further, cognitive clustering across the regions of the network suggests that social and perceptual knowledge share neural pattern similarities as does semantic and episodic knowledge with nominal being represented distinctly from the two. These findings fall within hypothesised domain-specificity boundaries {Spunt:2017jy} suggesting that declarative memory (episodic, semantic tasks) and language (nominal tasks) are part of cognitive macro-domain, while facial reception (physical tasks) and theory of mind (social tasks) are part of social-macro domain. 

## Network Taxonomy of the Person Knowledge System

Characterising regions by their response similarity allowed us to find groups of brain regions that are systematically recruited together. Similar to Haxby (2007) we found two distinct clusters of regions supporting core/extended systems division. Extending previous results we found that IFG and ventral Orbito-frontal cortex, which are integrative frontal regions, co-ordinate in their activity with lower-level perceptual regions - FFA and OFA. These findings are in line with top-down modulation account, which implicated both IFG and OFC in semantic control (Berlin, 2004; Dalley, 2011) . Within the extended system we found two further distinct cluster. 
**Extended-DMN**
Precuneus, medial PFC, Anterior Temporal Lobes (ATLs) and Posterior Superior Temporal Sulci (pSTS/TPJs) share high similarity in their response profiles, suggesting co-ordinated activity. Binder (2009) showed that across a range of studies the DMN can be not only identified in semantic contrasts, but is also modulated by task content. In the same meta-analysis, IFG has been observed as part of the task-deactivated default mode network, which we see de-coupling in our results. 
**ATFP**
Characterising regions based on their response profiles placed atFP {Rajimehr:2009ka} into extended system, suggesting higher order cognitive role as more likely than perceptual. Closest response profile to atFP was the amygdala, an extensively studied extended system region. Both face patch and the amygdala exhibited a pattern of response that showed preferential response for trustworthiness and attractiveness. 
**Conclusions**

[ ] tasks, 

In conclusion, the current study examined how the core/extended person perception system behaves across a wide range of tasks. We’ve observed that ATL, while active during nominal knowledge retrieval, preferentially responds to other kinds of tasks, informing previous literature. 
Multiple-task approach allowed to investigate not only face-selectivity but also cognitive preferences of regions involved thinking about familiar people. We observed that frontal regions (IFG and OFC) are closely involved ‘core’ activity, likely modulating perceptual regions. Within the extended system, the default mode network has a unique role that is shared across the regions. Extended-DMN component is separate from the rest of the extended system regions and acts more like a monolithic functional unit than a collection of independent ROIs. Anterior Fusiform Face Patch (atFP) has a response profile consistent with one expected from an extended system region, for the first time placing this region in a cognitive processing hierarchy.

Levelling the playing field - we hypothesise that all these regions are involved and strongly activated across the range of cognitive dimensions related to other people but that the cognitive flexibility of this network is endowed by subtle differences which exist in the pan-network pattern of these activations, which is in turn bolstered by coordination with brain regions outside the classes core/extended network for knowing about other people.



Anterior Temporal Face Patch (ATFP) is a recently discovered face selective region, existence of which was predicted from macaque maps {Rajimehr:2009ka}. Due to signal dropout when imaging the temporal lobe, this region suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Majority of studies to date have focused on confirming the existence of this region {VonDerHeide:2013hq}, - studies investigating whether this region is more perceptual or semantic (whether it belongs to core or extended system) are still lacking. [discussion]

Studies have found different response profiles for anterior and posterior portions of pSTS, former exhibiting perceptual preference consistent with core function while latter is involved in higher order cognitions {Shao:2017bf} [move this sentence later]


-----excised-----
These we chosen to cover a broad patch of the person cognition space and also to tap into the functions assoicated with internalised cognition. 
we can expect to extract brain patterns that are robust enough to see what aspect of person knowledge drives individual regions involved in person perception. We expect that looking at faces and recalling person specific knowledge will maximise the activation of both core and extended systems.

[x] list all specific hypotheses 

Importantly, by utilising this approach, we can relate cognitions to not only a baseline but to place it in a cognitive context, we predict: (1) similar degree of pSTS engagement for tasks loading of perceptual processing and social cognition if pSTS is indeed involved in both. (2) Anterior Lobe showing preference for either nominal or social knowledge, while even engagement in all tasks would support semantic hub hypothesis. By seeing how a particular brain region responds to different tasks can be informative of its place in the core/extended network hierarchy. We predict that regions performing similar functions, for example ‘core’ regions (OFA, FFA, pSTS) should also fluctuate similarly across tasks. Core region’s patterns of activity should be distinct from regions belonging to the extended system, since putatively they are tuned to process different stimulus features. Whether ATFP has a pattern consistent with the function of ’core’ of ’extended’ system, would, for the first time, place it in face perception hierarchy. (3) We predict high correlation with ‘core’ regions if ATFP performs a function from perceptual processing class, and high correlation with extended regions if ATFP is involved in semantic processing. 
Additionally we can also look for similarity in groups of brain regions across tasks to further investigate whether DMN processes overlapping or distinct features of person knowledge. If they process overlapping information we can expect to observe co-ordinated fluctuation across tasks, however if they are tuned to process different aspects of person knowledge we should observe low pattern
