# fMRI Face Paper

# Abstract

Familiar faces prompt the recall diverse kinds of person-related knowledge (their name, occupation, personal experience, associated social and perceptual traits). The way the this information is dynamically encoded within the well-characterised ‘face’ network (core and extended systems {Gobbini:2007it}) is still uncertain. *However, how this information is combined across known face perception neural substrates (core and extended systems {Gobbini:2007it}) is still unknown.* To address this issue we had participants perform ten different tasks which required accessing five different kinds of person knowledge (Social, Episodic, Factual, Physical, Nominal). By directly comparing different cognitions, we are able to test relative role of specific cognitive processes in specific brain regions, such as the role of the ATL is social or nominal knowledge. Furthermore, novel Network level Representational Similarity Analysis (netRSA) provides insight into underlying organisation of **face selective regions at the systems-level. The IFG and OFC coordinate closely with early perceptual regions in the core system (FFA, OFA, pSTS) while the Anterior Temporal Face Patch (ATFP) is more consistent with regions belonging to extended system regions. Collectively the results that core and extended system can be characterised by response similarity. IFG and OFC show patterns of response fitting with core-function and are distinct from extended system. Within the extended system, default mode network acts as an independent processing module distinct from other (amydgala, ATFP) extended system regions. 

# Introduction

Seeing a familiar person brings into awareness variety of related attributes: biographical faces (semantic knowledge), personal experience (episodic knowledge), physical attributes (perceptual knowledge), trustworthiness (social knowledge) or their name (nominal knowledge).  We use this rich trove of person specific information frequently in our day-to-day lives , however, how this diverse information is represented in the brain is still largely unclear. 
Neuroimaging studies have identified an interconnected network of regions that activates when we see and think about familiar people {Haxby:2000vnb, Gobbini:2007it, Fairhall:2007dq}. This network is said to be comprised of a ‘core system’ consisting of occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA, FFA) {Gauthier:2000it, Kanwisher:1997wr} and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). This core system thought to be involved in perceptual processing of faces aiding recognition
Additionally the network contains an ‘extended component’ - a complimentary set of regions implicated in a broad range of person related cognition less related to perception {Haxby:2000vnb}. 
Regions in the core/extended person perception system have been studied extensively. However, numerous investigations of what these regions contribute to person perception have not reached a consensus and many areas of discord exist in the literature (table 1). For example, the pSTS is disunited a perceptual regions of the core system but is often linked with social cognition unrelated to perception (Adolphs, 2003, Saxe, Fairhall 2013hn); the ATL is frequently implicated in proper naming {Semenza:2011hn, Grabowski:2001jk, Gesierich:2011tv} but also in person recognition {Olson:2007jm, Glosser:2003eh, Tippett:2000ez} and social cognition (ref ref ; see simmons and martin for a review). *One reason for the failure to reach consensus may be that these the majority of extant studies address specific cognitive functions in specific brain regions. [moved from start of paragraph].*

[x] mention that all ROIs are involved in everything


[ ] ATFP and it’s hypotheses
[x] ATL hyptheses

[link with preceding sentence - both points are valid —>] One potential reason for the lack of consensus in findings is the extensively broad range of functions attributed to regions of the extended system. Anatomically, the extended system falls within the default mode network (DMN), originally characterised by task-based deactivation {Raichle:2001fk}. This network is now associated with: general semantics knowledge {Binder:2009je, Huth:2016jd,Fairhall:2013iq}; social cognition, {social cognition, trait attribution, Theory of Mind and more; Greene:2001ft}, {VanOverwalle:2009eh, VanOverwalle:2011jp}, episodic memory and mental time travel (Dona Rose and Schacter). 
Because regions of the DMN are frequently activated together, establishing whether these regions provide overlapping of distinct contributions has been challenging {VanOverwalle:2011jp, Moran:2011ct}. When studied in isolation, each region will be attributable to the researchers cognition-of-interest. Levelling the playing field. We hypothesise that all these regions are involved and strongly activated across the range of cognitive dimensions related to other people but that the cognitive flexibility of this network is endowed by subtle difference exist in the pan-network pattern of these a activation, which is in turn bolstered by coordination with brain regions outside the classes core/extended network for knowing about other people.

[ ] clear up the phrasing  

In the current experiment, we use rich stimuli while still maintaining interpretability. By asking our subjects to extract five different kinds of person knowledge we can expect to extract brain patterns that are robust enough to see what aspect of person knowledge drives individual regions involved in person perception. We expect that looking at faces and recalling person specific knowledge will maximise the activation of both core and extended systems.

[x] list all specific hypotheses

Importantly by utilising this approach, we can relate cognitions not only a baseline but to place it in a cognitive context, we predict: (1) similar degree of pSTS engagement for tasks loading of perceptual processing and social cognition if pSTS is indeed involved in both. (2) Anterior Lobe showing preference for either nominal or social knowledge, while even engagement in all tasks would support semantic hub hypothesis. By seeing how a particular brain region responds to different tasks can be informative of its place in the core/extended network hierarchy. We predict that regions performing similar functions, for example ‘core’ regions (OFA, FFA, pSTS) should also fluctuate similarly across tasks. Core region’s patterns of activity should be distinct from regions belonging to the extended system, since putatively they are tuned to process different stimulus features. Whether ATFP has a pattern consistent with the function of ’core’ of ’extended’ system, would, for the first time, place it in face perception hierarchy. (3) We predict high correlation with ‘core’ regions if ATFP performs a function from perceptual processing class, and high correlation with extended regions if ATFP is involved in semantic processing. 
Additionally we can also look for similarity in groups of brain regions across tasks to further investigate whether DMN processes overlapping or distinct features of person knowledge. If they process overlapping information we can expect to observe co-ordinated fluctuation across tasks, however if they are tuned to process different aspects of person knowledge we should observe low pattern similarity.

# Methods
## Participants

Twenty right-handed, native Italian participants (8 males; mean age: 23.2 years, range:19-32 years) took part in this study.  Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological incident. The study was approved by University of Trento ethical committee. All participants gave informed consent and were compensated for their time .

## Stimuli

Stimuli were 40 pictures of famous faces and 40 pictures of famous buildings **(???)** presented Stimuli of famous faces were selected following a behavioural experiment to ensure that stimuli and individual were highly recognisable. The stimulus set consisted of politicians, actors, singers, businessmen and sportsmen – both foreign and Italian. 
After the experiment 13/20 participants were presented with faces they saw in the experiment and asked whether they recognised the celebrity. On average, the subjects recognised M=84%  of faces.

## Task
![Schematic representation of the experiment. Five Domains fo person knowledge and two questions per domain are noted in different colours (top). Experimental blocks were preceded by 4s of instruction screen, and 6s fixation point. Each trial consisted of .5s face presentation and 2s for response.](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1500565850678_Screen+Shot+2017-07-20+at+17.50.32.png)


Experiment included questions from five categories of person knowledge: episodic memories, factual knowledge, social knowledge, nominal knowledge, perceptual knowledge. For each of the categories, we chose two different probe questions that require access to each kind of knowledge to answer , totalling ten experimental conditions (see figure X). In addition there were two 1-back matching control task with either pictures of faces or famous monuments.
Each experimental block started with 4s instruction screen specifying the task, followed by 6s of fixation cross. After that a face was presented for .5s followed by 2s of fixation cross during which subjects provided response via button box.  
The experiment consisted of five runs (8 min 42 s each). In each run, 16 blocks (8 trial per block) were presented in a randomised order. 
******[have we talked about pre-scanner training]?**

## Data Acquisition

Participants were scanned at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University of Trento. Data was collected using Bruker BioSpin MedSpec 4T, with 8-channel phased-array head coil. Five runs of 209 EPI volumes, consisting of 34, AC-PC aligned axial slices were acquired while participants performed the task (FOV = 64mm x 64mm, TR=2.5s, TE=33, FA=73°). Voxel size was 3x3x3.  **(was there a  gap)**
In addition to functional data, whole brain T1 MPRAGE anatomical image was acquired (whole brain  (FOV= 256x224, 176 1mm axial slices).

## ROI definition
[x] add pSTS / Angular explanation

Regions of interest were selected form an independent (N=4x**4****x**) dataset where participants performed a 1-back matching task with 12 second (check) blocks of famous faces, common animals or common objects. ***Contrast faces>places (p < .05 FWE) was used to select face selective peaks (table x).***  6mm radius spheres were drawn around the peak voxels and task evoked brain responses (betas) were extracted (one beta per ROI/task/subject). **[we need to hit this better in the into]** To address whether pSTS and angular gyrus/TPJ are functionally overlapping or distinct (see introduction) we anatomically constrained the volume with angular and superior temporal gyri masks. Then the masks were inflated and the overlap was removed. This allowed us to distinguish face selective anatomical activation within anatomical angular and superior temporal gyri, removing the overlap helped ensure that the angular and pSTS ROIs did not cross anatomical boundaries.

## Data Analysis

Data was preprocessed with SPM12. Functional images were realigned to account for motion, grey matter segmented, and warped into common space and smoothed with 8mm FWHM kernel. Subject specific response estimates (Beta weights) were derived by fitting a general linear model (GLM) to the data. 12 regressors (10 tasks, 2 controls) were included as explanatory variables. Six motion parameters from re-alignemnt procedure were included as regressors of no interest.
We drew 6mm spheres around peak coordinates (table x), and extracted the mean beta value from significantly active at p<0.1 within those ROIs. To isolate the magnitude of cognitive response, from each ROI values (10 values, one value per cognitive task) we subtracted beta value for 1-back matching face control task.   

## Multivariate Analyses

ROI responses across tasks were correlated to obtain a dissimilarity matrix (1-*R*), which was then subjected to clustering using Ward algorithm (netRSA). Similarly, for task similarity analysis (task-RSA) the matrix was tilted so that similarity matrix consisted of task correlation across ROIs.

![Data analysis schematic. ROI beta averages for ten tasks were correlated and subjected to RSA.  ](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1500569705030_image.png)

## Univariate Analyses

To ease result interpretation and lessen the number of comparisons, when performing univariate analyses we collapsed across similar task pairs (see methods: task) and left and right hemispheres repeated measures ANOVA showed no effect of hemisphere, effectively resulting in a reduced  5 task design. 

# Results

Subjects were presented with faces of famous people and answered questions that involved different kinds of person knowledge. Twenty-one (21) face selective ROIs were selected from an independent dataset (faces > places contrast, N=44). We performed univariate analyses and multivariate network RSA to address questions about regional involvement in person knowledge as well as network function. 

## Reaction times

Mean reaction time was M = 1.20, SD = 0.11. Reaction times (RTs) differed across the 10 tasks F(9,**df**) = 17.13, p<.001, but, importantly, not across five a priori selected domains of knowledge (‘Nominal' 'Physical' 'Social' 'Episodic' 'Factual’) F(4**,df**) = 2.21 p=.076. RT did not differ between the two control tasks (face/place 1-back matching tasks) t(18) = 1.96, p= .066 
Thus, critically, our five cognitive domains were matched in terms of task difficulty.

[ ] not for RTs. you performed two separate ANOVAs - this need to be made clearer

## Cognitive preferences 

Firstly, before moving onto systems level organisation, we address competing hypotheses about the functional role of brain regions. 
**Social and nominal processing in the ATL**
As previously discussed, whether the ATL is involved more in nominal or social processing is a matter of current contention (*& semantic???*). The relative importance of our five cognitive domains was assessed directly via repeated measures ANOVA. As there were no interactions between task and hemisphere (f-values < ***, p-values < .***) subsequent results are presented collapsed across hemisphere. The ATLs response differed between tasks *F*(4,95) = 8.13, p= < .001. Post hoc pairwise tests showed that ATL response to nominal tasks was lower than for episodic, factual, social or physical tasks ( all t-values > 2.49, all p-values< .02). No other pairwise comparisons were significant. 
~~In contrast,~~ ~~modulation~~ ~~of the IFG~~ ~~by task F(4,95) = 4.52 p = .002 and a main effect of hemisphere, left hemisphere responds more on average F(1,95) = 5.29, p=.027. Posthoc, pairwise tests showed that left IFG responded more strongly to nominal tasks than episodic, social or physical tasks (t > 2.6, p < .017) and Right IFG responded less to social tasks than physical or nominal tasks (t > 2.4 p < .026).~~ 
~~Relative to other tasks ATL are inhibited during proper name processing, while the left IFG shows cognitive tuning for proper n~~~~ames~~~~. Right IFG is suppressed during social knowledge retrieval.~~ 

**Perceptual and non-perceptual processing in the pSTS/TPJ.**
Angular gyrus responded more during episodic memory retrieval than any other task t(> 2.8 p< .0102),
[pSTS not responsive to anything]

## Network Taxonomy

](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1504561461165_Screen+Shot+2017-09-04+at+23.43.37.png)


To find clusters of similarly behaving ROIs we performed a network level Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). For each ROI, pan-task beta patterns were pairwise correlated and subjected to hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis (see methods), which identified three distinct clusters (figure 2). The most immediately striking feature of the result is the close proximity of left and right regional homologues. In all cases, despite the anatomical distance, a given ROI’s cognitive profile matched most closely to that of intent contralateral counterpart. This is an important internal validation of the netRSA approach (to our knowledge this is the first implementation of such an approach). 
netRSA revealed both the expected cognitive clustering of core regions (OFA, FFA, pSTS) and the interesting cognitive coupling of these regions with the the orbito-frontal and inferior frontal gyri (OFC & IFG; Cluster 1,’Core[???}’,red).  Within the extended system, regions overlapping with those involved in default mode form a distinct cluster (Cluster 2,’extended-DMN’,green) from amygdala and the anterior face patch (Cluster 3,’extended-ventromedial’,yellow).  
To assess cluster significance we compared mean within cluster correlation (e.g OFA-IFG) with across cluster correlation (e.g OFA-Precuneus). Within cluster correlation was significantly higher  than across t(19) = 8.29, p<.001. 

[x] unclear / clear up

Addionally, we  performed bootstrapping replicability analysis by resampling, with replacement, 10/20 subjects and recomputing the clustering for 10 000 iterations (see cluster stability). 
Regions of the core-frontal produce reliably different patterns of activity (78%) (figure x). Within the extended system, regions involved in default-mode (DMN) can also be reliably differentiated based on their response profiles (93%). Amygdala and ATFP clusters reliably together (88%). All together, regional clustering is extremely robust and three clusters identified in group average can be identified across resampling iterations


[x] *[Move the bootstrap result up to here (you’ll have to split it up but I think it needs to be here)]*
## Cognitive Taxonomy

Our condition-rich experimental design afforded an unique opportunity to quantitatively compare patterns of activity related to different cognitive tasks. Task-RSA was performed across ROIs to investigate how similar are the neural representations of different conditions (Figure 3.). 

![Figure 3. Task similarity in core/extended system ROIs. Physical  and social knowledge retrieval tasks elicit differentiable patters than Semantic, Episodic or Naming tasks. Thick Blue line signifies rfx < .05. 
](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1504561471926_Screen+Shot+2017-09-04+at+23.43.30.png)


Results reveal three distinct clusters of tasks, t(19) = 5.24 p<  .001. Physical (green) and social (yellow) knowledge relies on similar patterns of activity that are distinct from those produced when access to proper names (cyan), semantic (purple) or episodic (red) knowledge is required.  Social and Perceptual tasks are significantly more similar to each other (xx%) and different from semantic & episodic (xx%) and nominal knowledge tasks, which in turn are similar between themselves (xx%). 

![Regional preference patterns.  A) Two distinct topographies can be seen across 5 domains of knowledge. B) Nominal and Physical knowledge tasks engaged frontal and core regions more than other tasks. C) Social, Episodic & Factual knowledge engaged the Default Mode Network.  ](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_35BA3476E0E99705B87EED6FA25A97D3C3BCFD61E7449912D5958C7706EAA53E_1503503162633_Screen+Shot+2017-08-23+at+17.45.48.png)

## Preference Patterns

Both network-RSA and task-RSA [we use this differently netRSA for me is rsa done on ROIs not voxels) require collapsing across a dimension complimentary to the variable of interest. That means while Network-RSA is powerful approach to reveal clusters of regions sharing response similarity, it is silent about how tasks are represented in these clusters. And while task-RSA can tell us how tasks are represented across the network it does not tell which which groups of tasks load on which regions. We addressed cluster-task relationship question with a univariate analysis by comparing regional preferences across regions. For every ROI we compared its activation for each task and the mean activation during other tasks in a paired samples t-test (figure x). Episodic and factual knowledge 


## Whole Brain Analysis - Beyond the person-selective network

So far we have focussed our analysis on the well-characterised network for person knowledge. It is important to consider that these systems presumably pair and couple with brain regions outside the person-elective network. 
After having demonstrated that most regions in the extended system do not specialise for one specific task but instead actively respond to more than one, in some cases all tasks (e.g. Left IFG) we have to remind ourselves that even though different cognitions rely on overlapping neural substrates, each different cognition engages the brain in a different way. 
Access nominal knowledge is characterised by a broad pattern of activation, stronger on the left hemisphere than the right (figure). It encompasses well-known sites of activation associated with language production, such as Wernickes area, Broca’s area, as well as superior frontal gyri, as well left OFC and left FFA.
Conversely, accessing perceptual knowledge is more pronounced on the right than the left hemisphere, and includes right IFG and right OFC and right FFA.
Social knowledge retrieval activates left ATL and dmPFC also consistent with previous literature. 
Recalling episodic memories involved the precuneus, angular gyrus as well as right later frontal pole and bilateral SFG to a greater extent than other tasks do. 
Factual knowledge retrieval tasks did not produce significant clusters of activity.

# Discussion

Cognitive processes are distributed across networks of regions. By having our participants perform a broad range of cognitive tasks and using contemporary statistical tools, such as RSA that actually benefit form data complexity we could focus on the subtle differences in inter-regional coordination that endow distributed cortical networks their considerable cognitive flexibility. By relating task activity not only to a baseline but to activity during other tasks we were able to establish regional preferences which allowed us to tackle specific hypothesis about regional function. Multivariate methods benefit from rich data which we leveraged to gain insights into regional coordination, uncovering robust principles of network organisation. We also show that it is possible to quantify the similarity between different cognitive processes to build a cognitive taxonomy grounded in brain representation.  
DCM studies have been successful in showing the connectivity within the network.{Fairhall:2007dqa} showed that pre-frontal cortices form task induced connection with regions of the core system when person-related information is being extracted from a face.  
{Druzgal:2003eq} observed high similarity in the time course of FFA and IFG. Additionally, they found that while FFA was not strongly affected by whether there were one, two, or three faces on the screen, this parametrically modulated the IFG. {Mechelli:2004cp} found that this connection between FFA and IFG is face specific, disappearing if the stimulus changes from faces, to chairs. These experiments potentially challenge the configuration of the core system, suggesting that at least some regions in the frontal lobe might be necessary to ‘core’ function of face perception.

{Shao:2017bf} evaluated activation profiles of face selective regions in a high a condition-rich experiment. In a single experiment, they presented participants with pictures of items form 16 different categories. Relying on activation pattern across conditions, instead of magnitude response, authors were able to characterise the organization of the core face perception system, distinct response profiles between two different parts of pSTS, ventral pSTS has a response profile consistent with regions of the core system, and dorsal pSTS, together with ATFP that have similar profile between themselves that is distinct from core behavior, potentially shedding light on pSTS controversial involvement in both core and extended function (table 1). Given the success of {Shao:2017bf} in using cognitive profiles across tasks to characterise regions of the core system, this even more ambitious experiment investigated the functional organisation of both core and extended systems.
By directly comparing different cognitions it is possible to delineate the contributions of regions to person perception. {Moran:2011ct} contrasted physical judgements and character judgements about people and found that mPFC responds more to character judgements and the precuneus responds more to physical judgments. Such inference would not have been possible without a direct comparison of cognitions in a single experiment.  With machine learning techniques such as pattern classification and clustering analyses gaining popularity in neuroscientific research, using rich, varying stimuli as opposed to controlled stimuli has increasingly been an advantage. Sampling semantic categories widely allows to examine brain patterns more robustly, leading to better MVP classification accuracies {Mitchell:2008iz}, and ascribe very specific cognitive functions to brain regions {Huth:2016ih}. However, clearly there is a balance to be struck between using rich and controlled stimuli as using stimuli that vary a lot can impair interpretability of results (i.e brain activity patterns that only classifier understands) {e.g Mitchell:2008iz}.

## Regional function

The importance of anterior temporal lobes to both conceptual and person knowledge has been strongly supported by evidence. However, with ATL being implicated in a wide variety of tasks its more precise function remains shrouded in mystery. Different hypotheses propose that ATL might mediate person-specific social knowledge {Olson:2007jm}, proper naming {Semenza:2011hn}, or acts as a semantic hub for all kinds of conceptual knowledge {Patterson:2007bw}.
{Gesierich:2011eu} showed that ATL is involved in semantic processing regardless of lexical access. We were able to replicate this finding and further narrow down ATL function by showing that is it not responding to tasks loading on nominal knowledge, but does respond to most other kinds of knowledge retrieval. Current phrasing of hub-and-spoke model of knowledge representation is inconsistent with these findings as it hypothesises that all modality specific sources, converge in the ATL {Ralph:2016gh}. It is however, plausible that nominal knowledge is represented in a different way from other kinds of knowledge (see below: task representation).
 Our network-RSA results shed further light on ATL activity by showing that at least during person perception tasks it works in close coordination with other regions of the default-mode network, acting as part of a distinct functional unit instead of working in isolation. 
We’ve found no evidence of ATL preferential response to naming tasks despite numerous studies that have found robust ATL activation during proper naming, instead we’ve observed strong IFG involvement in naming tasks. 

## Cognitive Taxonomy in Person Knowledge 

By looking at how differing cognitive processes rely on similar or diverse neural structures one can get an insight into the way cognitive processes are represented in the mind. For each kind of knowledge tested (physical, social, semantic, episodic, nominal) we selected two exemplar tasks that required the participant to make different kinds of judgements about a person (trustworthy or friendly) while still belonging to the same category (both are social judgements). First, the apriori selected task examplars were matched together during clustering, albeit with a notable presence of noise (note the physical-social task cluster). Further, cognitive tuning across the regions of the network suggests that social and perceptual knowledge share neural similarities as does semantic and episodic knowledge with nominal being represented distinctly from the two. 
These findings fall within hypothesised domain-specificity boundaries {Spunt:2017jy} suggesting that declarative memory (episodic, semantic tasks) and language (nominal tasks) are part of cognitive macro-domain, while facial reception (physical tasks) and theory of mind (social tasks) are part of social-macro domain. 

## Network Taxonomy of the Person Knowledge System

Characterising regions by their response similarity allowed us to find groups of brain regions that are systematically recruited together. Similar to Haxby (2007) we found two distinct clusters of regions supporting core/extended systems division. Extending previous results we found that IFG and ventral Orbito-frontal cortex, which are integrative frontal regions, co-ordinate in their activity with lower-level perceptual regions - FFA and OFA. These findings are in line with top-down modulation account, which implicated both IFG and OFC in semantic control (Berlin, 2004; Dalley, 2011) . Within the extended system we found two further distinct cluster. 
**Extended-DMN**
Precuneus, medial PFC, Anterior Temporal Lobes (ATLs) and Posterior Superior Temporal Sulci (pSTS/TPJs) share high similarity in their response profiles, suggesting co-ordinated activity. Binder (2009) showed that across a range of studies the DMN can be not only identified in semantic contrasts, but is also modulated by task content. In the same meta-analysis, IFG has been observed as part of the task-deactivated default mode network, which we see de-coupling in our results. 
**ATFP**
Characterising regions based on their response profiles placed atFP {Rajimehr:2009ka} into extended system, suggesting higher order cognitive role as more likely than perceptual. Closest response profile to atFP was the amygdala, an extensively studied extended system region. Both face patch and the amygdala exhibited a pattern of response that showed preferential response for trustworthiness and attractiveness. 
**Conclusions**
In conclusion, the current study examined how the core/extended person perception system behaves across a wide range of tasks. ATL, while active during nominal knowledge retrieval, preferentially responds to other kinds of tasks, informing previous literature. 
Multiple-task approach allowed to investigate not only face-selectivity but also cognitive preferences of regions involved thinking about familiar people. We observed that frontal regions (IFG and OFC) are closely involved ‘core’ activity, likely modulating perceptual regions. Within the extended system, the default mode network has a unique role that is shared across the regions. Extended-DMN component is separate from the rest of the extended system regions and acts more like a monolithic functional unit than a collection of independent ROIs. Anterior Fusiform Face Patch (atFP) has a response profile consistent with one expected from an extended system region, for the first time placing this region in a cognitive processing hierarchy.
